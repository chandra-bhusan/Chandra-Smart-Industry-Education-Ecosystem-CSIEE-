📝 PROJECT OVERVIEW

This project is a Digital Transformation (DX)-oriented internal system designed to streamline employee attendance management, salary processing, and HR workflows using Python, Microsoft Excel, VBA, and Microsoft Access–style CRUD operations.
It strongly aligns with the Information Systems Department role at HAS Co., Ltd., especially in areas such as General Affairs DX, Accounting DX, workflow automation, data visualization, and internal system development.

The system provides full CRUD operations for employee records including Employee ID, Name, Department, Base Salary, and Overtime Rate, similar to internal database management performed in Microsoft Access.
It includes a check-in/check-out attendance system where timestamps are captured in real time, stored, and processed for salary calculation.
Using Python automation and Excel VBA scripting, the project automates data processing, generates payroll sheets, and builds visualization dashboards to support better decision-making while reducing manual workload.

This project demonstrates key skills required by HAS:

IT infrastructure understanding

Internal system development

Data automation

Excel and VBA digitalization

Python scripting for productivity enhancement

Operational efficiency improvement

Support for HR, General Affairs, and Accounting workflows

DX-driven system modernization

Paperless operations and workflow optimization

The project directly aligns with HAS’s focus on:

General Affairs DX (attendance management, workflow digitalization)

Accounting DX (salary calculation automation)

Manufacturing DX (data visualization and reporting)

Internal tool development and process improvement

Automation of repetitive tasks

Microsoft 365 and Excel-based optimization

By automating attendance tracking, overtime calculation, and salary generation, the system reduces manual work, improves data accuracy, and enhances efficiency—supporting HAS’s mission of creating a smart, digitally transformed workplace.
This project reflects my ability to contribute to HAS’s goals in DX, IT system improvement, internal workflow automation, and company-wide digital modernization.
